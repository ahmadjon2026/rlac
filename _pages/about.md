I am Ahmadjon, a senior undergraduate student expected to graduate in January 2027. This site documents my work in CDAD-UH 1024Q, a course focused on digital textual analysis and computational approaches to reading.

Throughout the semester, I explore how tools like Voyant and R can help us analyze large corpora, visualize patterns in language, and reflect on the limits and possibilities of distant reading. This site includes my assignments, responses, and experiments in reading like a computer.
